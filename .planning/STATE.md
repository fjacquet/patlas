# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-05-15)

**Core value:** A user drops a RVTools workbook and walks away with a polished, shareable HTML report and PPTX deck describing their VMware estate — without uploading a single byte. The report is the product.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Foundation & Invariants

## Current Position

Phase: 1 (Foundation & Invariants) — EXECUTING
Plan: 1 of 5
Status: Executing Phase 1

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: 7 phases under horizontal-layers structure (Foundation → Aggregation → Inventory → Analytics Core → EOS → Trends → Exports+Deploy)
- Stack: vsizer's stack at 2026-05 versions + ECharts (SVG renderer, tree-shaken) + live-DOM HTML report serialization
- Privacy: runtime fetch/XHR/WS/Beacon guard lands in Phase 1 before any feature is tempted to add telemetry
- Math: branded `MiB`/`GiB`/`GHz` types in Phase 1 make MB-is-MiB and MHz-vs-GHz bugs unrepresentable
- Multi-vCenter: keyed on `(VI SDK UUID, vm_bios_uuid)`, never silent merge on names — lands in Phase 4

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 1 must harvest 4+ real RVTools workbooks (one per generation: 3.10, 3.11, 4.0, 4.4) from `~/Downloads/`, `~/Library/CloudStorage/OneDrive-Home/`, and `vsizer/public/samples/rvtools-sample.xlsx` to lock in column-alias dictionary and MB-is-MiB canary
- Phase 4 must verify whether RVTools `vCluster` exposes host fault-domain or site tag in current versions (if not, engine surfaces `confidence: 'medium'` with "assumed symmetric" chip)
- Phase 5 needs research pass: OS-naming-variant matrix (harvest 50+ real OS strings; assert <5% unknown-OS rate) and `endoflife.date` v1 API Beta schema stability
- Phase 7 needs research pass: HTML-report font-embedding mechanism (subset selection, corporate-VPN CSP proxy testing, file:// vs http:// vs proxy rendering)
